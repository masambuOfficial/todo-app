# Interactive Task Management Tool
This is an interactive task management tool built with React.js and Tailwind CSS. The tool allows users to manage their to-do list effectively, with features for adding, editing, deleting, and marking tasks as completed. The application state persists using localStorage to ensure data is retained across page reloads. The user interface is enhanced with Font Awesome icons and Google Fonts for a visually appealing design.
